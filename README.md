# Easy Learn 📱
This is a small **Android OS based App** project, developed for the **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** course of my **BSc Computer Engineering major**.
The aim of this app is to give a first easy and sweet approach to the **Computer Science World to complete beginners**. Users can read up to date **guides about the latest technology** and also test their knowledge throughout **multiple choice quizzes**.
